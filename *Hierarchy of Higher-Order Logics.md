# Hierarchy of Higher-Order Logics

### **Hierarchy of Higher-Order Logics: From First-Order to n-th Order Logic**

Higher-order logic extends classical **first-order logic (FOL)** by allowing quantification over predicates, functions, and relations. Here's a breakdown:

#### **1. First-Order Logic (FOL)**
- **Quantification:** Only over individual elements of the domain (e.g., ∀x, ∃x).
- **Variables:** Range over objects in the domain.
- **Limitations:** Cannot express concepts like finiteness, transitivity of reachability, or properties that require quantification over predicates (e.g., compactness in topology).

#### **2. Second-Order Logic (SOL)**
- **Quantification:** Over both individual elements **and** predicates (e.g., ∀P, ∃P).
- **Expressiveness:** Stronger than FOL; can define properties like the **Peano Axioms** for natural numbers uniquely.
- **Limitations:** Not compact; completeness fails (i.e., no sound and complete deductive system like FOL).

#### **3. Third-Order Logic (TOL)**
- **Quantification:** Over individual elements, predicates, and **sets of predicates** (higher-order predicates).
- **Expressiveness:** Can define more complex mathematical structures, such as classes of functions.
- **Example:** ∀F ∃G ∀x (G(x) → F(x)) — quantifying over **functions of predicates**.

#### **4. Fourth-Order Logic (4OL)**
- **Quantification:** Extends to predicates of third-order predicates, introducing **quantification over collections of sets of predicates**.
- **Example:** Used in formalizing some areas of category theory and higher-order type theories.

#### **5. n-th Order Logic (nOL)**
- **Generalization:** n-th order logic extends k-th order logic by allowing quantification over predicates of (k-1)-th order predicates.
- **Infinite Hierarchy:** Each order allows quantification over structures defined at the previous level.
- **Expressiveness:** **nOL becomes increasingly expressive** but loses properties like compactness and completeness beyond first order.

### **Key Properties Across Higher-Order Logics**
| Order | Quantifies Over | Example |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| 1st | Individuals | ∀x (P(x) → Q(x)) |
| 2nd | Predicates | ∀P ∃x P(x) |
| 3rd | Predicates of predicates | ∀F ∃P ∀x (P(x) → F(x)) |
| 4th | Sets of predicates | ∀G ∃F ∀P G(P, F(P)) |
| n-th | (n-1)-th order predicates | ∀H ∃G ∀F H(F, G(F)) |

### **Implications in Mathematics & Logic**
- **Set Theory:** Higher-order logics correspond to certain fragments of ZFC set theory.
- **Type Theory:** Strongly connected to **dependent type theory** and **lambda calculus**.
- **AI & Computation:** Useful in reasoning about higher-level abstractions, e.g., in **higher-order theorem provers** (Coq, Lean).
